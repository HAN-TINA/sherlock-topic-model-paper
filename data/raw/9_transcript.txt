One day I was running late for work, I had to choose between having my bath or going to work without having my bath.I got to the elevator, and I met a someone with a briefcase in one hand while she reaches for the wall. I already pressed it and pressing it again will not make the elevator move faster. The number stopped at ground floor and the door open, IÂ  gesture for the woman to see me into the space. she smiled at me by nodding her head and I do not know her name perhaps it is Jane, Sarah. How long have you work at jackson, It is my first day, well have not been seeing her around so it could possibly be her first day. Actually, I have worked for them for six years and there is no way this girl could have worked for them for six years. she looks about 25. am doing my internship and have been here two months now, that is better and you. She would ask me , she would be has interested as I am. I am an assistant accountant on the twenty second floor, I would tell her so that she will know where to find me
