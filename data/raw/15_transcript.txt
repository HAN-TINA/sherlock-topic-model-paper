Monday I tapped nervously on the marble floors. I watched the numbers descent, I'm going to be late again but it wasn't my fault. My hours were swapped with george so he could leave work to pick his kids up from school. I needed to be in the office by 10 instead of 8. Since i was finishing later i tried to get to the gym in the morning. The elevator stopped and a women walked in, she used her elbow to press the 23 button just one floor above mine. It is just the two of us and so i decided to check her out. She was a tiny thing, with black curls and shiny black heals, which im a sucker for hills. we exchange names and chat a little. The next morning I get onto the elevator as i do every morning when heading off to work. The elevator stopped but the lady didnt get on. Maybe she dont work fridays i thought to myself, maybe she old works part time. I have a bunch of paperwork and i am the last one out of the office. everyone is already clocked out for the day, some even went to go out for drinks. Today was exhausting and slowing me down. I fall into the elevator as the door slides open. Its full of other people. but there is eleanor and my raininy day turns to sunshine. I was so happy i was unable to speak, she smiles and signs at me to.
