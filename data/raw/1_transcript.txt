There is someone that works at what sounds like a financial institution who is going to work everyday for a week. He originally dropped someone's wife off because she had surgery and decided to go to the gym, and ended up being late for work because he decided to take a shower instead of going to work with odor. He sees a woman in an elevator because he's late and starts to have an imaginary conversation with her in his head, making up what her name might be, who she is, how long she's worked there for, decided she is probably an intern because of how young she looked. He has been thinking about seeing her again and wanted to ask her for coffee before work or go to a jazz club after work and has thought about it the entire week, making up converastions he is imagining throughout the whole work week. One day he was mad he ended up being late because his cat puked and he imagined how that conversation would go. He ended up picking up his work friend's wife at the end of the week and found out the girl he imagined as Eleanor is going to be leaving.s
