one day i trapped my foot on the floor , i picked the kids up from school , you will think that will make me early as i try to go to the gym in the morning, i am not the only one running late today , the elevator did not move faster , i told the woman i met that i was adrian , i dont know her name perhaps its elizabeth or sarah but i will call her eleanor like the beatles song , i have not seen her around so it could very well be her first day , she looks about 25 she could not have been here for 6 years , i was an intern and i have been there for 2 months, i told her where i worked , i said some things so she could come find me , i am a big mark davis fan , i saw her the following day , her voice was husky , i saw her if she worked on time the previous day , she doesnt look like she slept in , she looked fresh and clean for a tuesday morning, i wait until the last possible moment on wednesday before i pressed the elevator button, just as the elevator began to close i heard a tap and it was her , she said thanks and smiled at me m i said youre welcome , running later again, i asked maybe we could catch up after work and listen to music , we could unwind and listen to music , i looked at my phone and checked the website and i was at myt floor without noticing when the elevator door closed while i was out , thursday i was late this time thanks to my bloody cat , i rushed to the elevator and there she is my eleanor , i said thanks but i dont know if she heard , my turn to be late again i told her about my cat and she told me about her cat , her cat is too fat to catch a mice, i am not ready to be. a crazy cat loverits her last day ,i can see my reflection shining back at me, look at all this lonely people
