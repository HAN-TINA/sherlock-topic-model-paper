Adrians shift is moved a few hours later because someones wife was in the hospital.  He now goes to the gym in the morning and has to come into work late or stinky.  He meets a woman his type named Eleanor, and rides the elevator with her. She pushes the button again, and he notices her outfit and she is wearing airpods, he wonders what type of music someone as cool as her would listen to.  They talk about how long they have worked there, and she says she it is her first day, then says she has had an internship for 2 months, which explains her briefcase full of papers. Adrian wonders if she is single. They then meet the next day, Adrian waiting for her to show up again, late.  They mumble some words.  The next day his cat leaves a dead mouse in the house, and he cleans it up and comes late again seeing her. This goes on for a few days, him coming late and seeing her in the elevator.  His shift then returns to normal and he does not see her.  He bumps into her again and she says that it is her last day at the work place.
