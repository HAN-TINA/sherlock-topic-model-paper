"It's Monday and the narrator has switched shifts with another worker, so he is working outside his normal hours. He debates going to the gym before work because he may not have enough time to get a shower in before going to work. He ends up getting in the elevator at work to go to his floor and encounters a woman with short black hair that he tries to look at without drawing her attention. He then proceeds to spend the entire elevator ride having an imaginary conversation with this woman, who he decides to name as Eleanor. It's clear that he's interested in her, but doesn't ask her out. Tuesday comes around and it's more of the same. Wednesday is the same as well. The narrator keeps finding excuses to stay in the elevator as long as possible to meet this woman hopefully and strike up a conversation, but he never does. He keeps having imaginary conversations with ""his"" Eleanor and continues to form a kind of parasocial relationship. Thursday rolls by and it's the same story all over again. At this point, he's imagined a number of different scenarios with her, such as listening to his favorite jazz musician together, but he still won't talk to her. Finally, Friday comes along and it's the last day for him on this alternate shift during which the woman also works. He ends up getting in the elevator at the end of the day and seems defeated, when a woman says ""Rough week?"" He turns and it's Eleanor, with a box of affects in her arms. He sees a name plate, Kamara. He gives a short response to her and she says that today is her last day. They ride down on the elevator together. He doesn't ask her out and the elevator doors close. He thinks of the Beatles song from earlier in the story, ""All The Lonely People."""
