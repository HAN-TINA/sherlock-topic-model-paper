 The narrator is late for work because she couldn't go to the gym and not take a shower. She waits for an elevator when she notices another woman that is also late. She finds this woman attractive. They smile and nod but she doesn't know her name. This narrator starts having conversations in her head about what her name could be and where she works as well as her age. This other woman leaves the elevator. She notices her a second time where the woman is listening to music, she begins having more conversations in her head about what she must be listening to. She's wanting to speak with the woman but doesn't. She starts describing to herself how she thinks they could get coffee together. Then later she sees her again on a morning she's late and begins thinking they should meet for evening drinks because she's not a morning person. Another time the narrator is late because of a cat emergency and sees the woman at the elevator again and begins with the internal conversations. She later learns it's the last day for her but the woman still leaves the elevator without having a conversation with the narrator.
