The woman was late for work. She was covering for a male co-worker. She got off from exercise and had to decide between being smelly and being late. She chose the latter. She met a female intern. There, she told her that she was an accountant and was on the second floor. The next day, she did not see the intern. She thought it was silly to expect to see her. As she went on the elevator, she saw her making staccato sounds and opened the elevator. She then talked to her. The next day, the woman talked to a female friend about her cat. The next day, she saw a person holding an A4 box. In the box was a nameplate. She started thinking about lonely people.
