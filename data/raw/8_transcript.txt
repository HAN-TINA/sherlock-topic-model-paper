Basically this assistant accountant has a lot of social anxiety and he sees a cute girl in heels which makes him think that she is out of his league and triggers his anxiety. He makes up a lot of things about her and how she is probably this perfect girl, but in reality he is just very delusional. Anyways, as the days pass he thinks about what will happen if he sees her in the elevator and what he will say to her like when his cat brings him a half eaten mouse but maybe that might scare her. He wants to take her to a bar with live music but he can barely even say hi to her. He said her name is Eleanor but I think he made that up like everything else he made up. On the last day she is holding a box with all of her things- which means it is her last day and he has this last shot to say something to her before she is gone forever. He still overthinks everything. I think he needs a really good therapist and maybe some Prozac.Â
